1. Task 1: Basic landing page using HTML, CSS.

The creation of a basic landing page using HTML and CSS is a fundamental step in building a website. A landing page is a crucial element of a website as it serves as the first point of contact between the user and the website. In this essay, we will delve into the details of creating a basic landing page using HTML and CSS, highlighting the importance of each element and the role they play in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website.

The HTML structure of the landing page is the backbone of the website. It provides the framework for the content and layout of the page. In our example, the HTML code is divided into two main sections: the people section and the about section. The people section displays a list of stakeholders with their images, names, and roles, while the about section provides a brief description of JabTV. The use of semantic HTML elements such as section, div, and p helps to create a clear and organized structure for the content.

The CSS styles add visual appeal and functionality to the HTML structure. The CSS code is used to control the layout, colors, and typography of the page. In our example, the CSS code is used to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The use of CSS selectors such as .people and .about allows us to target specific elements and apply styles to them. The CSS properties such as background-color, padding, and margin are used to create a visually appealing design.

One of the key elements of the landing page is the use of images. In our example, we use images to display the stakeholders in the people section. The use of images helps to break up the text and create a more engaging user experience. The CSS code is used to style the images, adding a border radius to create a circular shape and setting the width and height to ensure consistency across the page.
